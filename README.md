# Web API Quiz

 For this Project, I built a Weather Dashboard using Openweather's API. It was awesome reading through the documentation, and seeing it all come together. It was challenging getting the API key to work st the beginning, but once it started working it all came together like a puzzle. Feel free to check out the website to see weather in whichever city you choose!
